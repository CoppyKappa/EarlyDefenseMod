# UI CHANGES

Allowing the buildings mentioned before to be build at the dark age also means that we had to update the UI to fit the style better and the idea i had better .

All the buildings aviable to be build at the dark age are now in the age1 UI grid.

Your keybinds are not going to be affected by this change.

# About 1.2V 

For the next update of this mod i want to fix some of the UI issues , for example the most notable . "Traders can only be build at the feudal age" , however traders are able to be build at the dark age . I will fix that bug in the next update.

1.2V will also have balance updates for the next civs : Chinese , Rus , delhi sultanate.

But the most important thing about 1.2V is ...

Mongols. 

Mongols will be updated to fit this mod . Balance changes and some new additions to the civs will be also posible!

Only time and your feedback will help to shape the idea.
